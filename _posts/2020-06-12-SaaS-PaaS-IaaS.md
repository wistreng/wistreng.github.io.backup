- Iaas: INfrastructure-as-a-service
- PaaS: Platform-as-a-service
- SaaS: Software-as-a-service

What is the difference between them?

Albert Barron, IBM software architect use pizza to explain this questions [link](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140730172610-9679881-pizza-as-a-service/). David Ng refer this metaphorical explaination and go further [link](https://m.oursky.com/saas-paas-and-iaas-explained-in-one-graphic-d56c3e6f4606) 

Let's say you are a shop owner who want to do Pizza business.

You can made you own pizza from scratch, but this will cost you much since you have to prepare basically everything, from Kitchen euqipments to dinning tables, from raw materials to bake owen. It's a good idea you decide Outsourcing partial work to third party, now you have three choices:

**Scenario 1: IaaS**
All infrastrates such as kitchen, gas, owen are

**Scenario 2: PaaS**
Apart from infrastratures, doughs are provide

you need to add toppings, which means all you need concern is design taste and choose toppping, the rest work will leave to other.

**Scenario 3: SaaS**
The pizza had done by others, you don't need to get you hand dirty, all you need to do is selling it, maybe package it and mark your logo.

These three can conclude into this diagram

![New Piaaz as a service]()

From left to right, your workload is decreasing, IaaS > PaaS > SaaS.

The following diagram show the associated parts of software development

SaaS Software development, management, deployment had been taken care by third-party, as along as technical problems. All internet service could be considered as SaaS, for example:
 - Salesforce
 - google drive
 - one notes
 - ...

PaaS provide runtimes, make a abstraction of hardware and operation system detial, and support seamlessly scaling. Developers only focus business logic rather than underlying detials. The following are PaaS:
- google App Engine
- OpenShift

IaaS is the infrastructural layer of cloud service, it mainly offer some basic services. Compare to PaaS, users have to control the backend themselves, implementing underlying logic, the following belong to IaaS
- Amazon EC2

MS Azure have a diagram to explain the difference between those model

There is no such thing which is the best architech, the answer will alway be any model that suit your case is the best solution.

Hope these example help you clear up these concepts.
