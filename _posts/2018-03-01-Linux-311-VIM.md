*In the Linux world, most configuration files are plain text in ASCII, so you can modify the settings simply with text editing software! Unlike Microsoft's Windows, if you're used to Microsoft Word or other GUI, you'll find your text editing programs less intuitive and convenient, but we have to taste bitter before we can appreciate the sweet, isn't it?*

# Linux VI and VIM


## 1. Why

There are so many text editors, even in Linux world we still have many choices and we talked about the simple and easy to use Nano previous chapter. Now that you've learned the Nano, why bother to learn the not-so-friendly text editor? 


- `vi` document editors are built into all Unix Like systems. Other document - editors may not exist.
- Many individual software editing interfaces actively call VI (such as future - crontab, Visudo, Edquota, etc.);
- `vim` has the ability of program editing, and can actively distinguish the - correctness of grammar by font color, which is convenient for program design.
- Because the program is simple, editing is quite `fast`.


The important is the second point above, because many Linux commands using VI as an default interface for data editing.


So what is Vim? In fact, you can think of `vim` as an advanced version of VI, where vim can display special information in colors or lines, for example, when you vim a C program files or a shell script, vim will highlight the syntex based on the file extensions or file content. In short, vim is a "programme editor". Try vim /etc/fstab



## 2. Use the vi

Basically, VI has two modes, namely "edit mode" and "command mode". For the sake of clarification, I add a "default mode". The functions of these three modes are as follows:

- default mode:

    Opening a file in VI goes directly to default mode. In this mode, you can use the up, down, left, and right buttons to move the cursor, you can use delete characters or delete entire lines to handle file content, or copy and paste to handle your file data.


- Edit mode:

    In default mode, file can be deleted, copy, paste and so on but can not edit the file content until you press "I, I, O, o, A, A, R, R" and go into the edit mode. Pay attention! Typically in Linux when you press these buttons, the words "INSERT or REPLACE" appear in the lower left corner of the screen to allow editing. To return to default mode, you must press "Esc" to exit edit mode.


- Command mode:

    In default mode, type any of the three ": /?" to move the cursor to the bottom row. In this mode, you can search, read, save, replace a large number of characters, exit `vi`, display line number, etc.

### 2.1 Simple execution example

- use *vi* to enter the *default mode*
    You can do this if you want to use *vi* to create a file called test.txt

    `vi test.txt`

    the bottom line will display:

    `"test.txt" [New File]`

    if you open a existing file, it could be:

    `"/etc/man.config" 141L 4617C`

    means file has 141 lines and 4617 characters.

- use *i* to enter the *edit mode*
    you will found `-- INSERT --` at the bottom, you can edit the file content now.

- Press *esc* to exit edit mode

- Press `:wq` to save and exit vi

### 2.2 vi command

#### *default mode*


| key | human language translation |
| --- | -------- |
| `h` `j` `k` `l` | move the cursor |
| `0` [zero] | move the cursor to the start of current line | 
| `$` | move the cursor to the end of current line |
| `^f` | move forward one screen |
| `^b` | move backward one screen |
| `^d` | move down half screen |
| `^u` | move up half screen |
| `n<Space>` | move n space |
| `nG` | move to line n |
| `gg` | move to start of line one, not good game |
| `n<Enter>` | move donw n line |
| `w` | begining of next word |
| `b` | begining of last word |


#### *switch between default mode and edit mode*


| * | key | human language translation |
| - | --- | -------- |
| * | `i` | insert text before cursor, until `<Esc>` hit |
|   | `I` | insert text at beginning of current line, until <Esc> hit |
| * | `a` | append text after cursor, until `<Esc>` hit |
|   | `A` | append text to end of current line, until `<Esc>` hit |
|   | `o` | open and put text in a new line below current line|
|   | `O` | open and put text in a new line above current line|


| * | key | human language translation |
| - | --- | -------- |
|   | `:w` | save |
|   | `:w!` | there is no such thing 'forced save', since you don't have permission :-o |
|   | `:q` | quit vi |
| * | `:q!` | quit without ask |
| * | `:wq` | save and quit |
| * | `ZZ` | save and quit |
| * | `:set nu` | display line number, `nonu` means no line number |


#### *command mode*
- searching

| key | translation |
| --- | ----------- |
| `/<string>` | forward search for occurence of *string* |
| `?<string>` | backward search for occurence of *string* |
| `n` | move to next search result |
| `N` | move opposite, which means if you current doing forward searching, it will move backwards |
| `:100,200s/config/Config/g` | search "config" and replace with "Config" between 100 and 200 lines |
| `:1,$s/word1/word2/gc` | Look for the Word1 string from the first line to the last line and replace it with word2! A prompt will display to confirm before replace |

- copy, paste and delete
    
|key| translation |
|---| ----------- |
|`x`, `X` |  在一行字当中，x 为向后删除一个字符 (相当于 [del] 按键)， X 为向前删除一个字符(相当于 [backspace] 亦即是退格键) (常用) |
| `nx`  |n 为数字，连续向后删除 n 个字符。举例来说，我要连续删除 10 个字符『10|x』|
| `dd`  |删除游标所在的那一整列(常用) |
| `ndd` |    n 为数字。删除光标所在的向下 n 列，例如 20dd 则是删除 20 列 (常用) |
| `d1G` |    删除光标所在到第一行的所有数据 |
| `dG`  |删除光标所在到最后一行的所有数据|
| `d$`  |删除游标所在处，到该行的最后一个字符|
| `d0`  |那个是数字的 0 ，删除游标所在处，到该行的最前面一个字符|
| `yy`  |复制游标所在的那一行(常用)|
| `nyy` |    n 为数字。复制光标所在的向下 n 列，例如 20yy 则是复制 20 列(常用)|
| `y1G` |    复制游标所在列到第一列的所有数据 |
| `yG`  |复制游标所在列到最后一列的所有数据|
| `y0`  |复制光标所在的那个字符到该行行首的所有数据|
| `y$`  |复制光标所在的那个字符到该行行尾的所有数据|
| `p`, `P`|    p 为将已复制的数据在光标下一行贴上，P 则为贴在游标上一行！ 举例来说，我目前光标在第 20 行，且已经复制了 10 行数据。则按下 p 后， 那 10 行数据会贴在原本的 20 行之后，亦即由 21 行开始贴。但如果是按下 P 呢？ 那么原本的第 20 行会被推到变成 30 行。 (常用)|
| `J`   |将光标所在列与下一列的数据结合成同一列|
| `c`   |重复删除多个数据，例如向下删除 10 行，[ 10cj ]|
| `u`   |复原前一个动作。(常用) `[Ctrl]+r`    重做上一个动作。(常用) 这个 u 与 [Ctrl]+r 是很常用的指令！一个是复原，另一个则是重做一次～ 利用这两个功能按键，你的编辑，嘿嘿！很快乐的啦！|
| `.`   | 不要怀疑！这就是小数点！意思是重复前一个动作的意思。 如果你想要重复删除、重复贴上等等动作，按下小数点『.』就好了！ (常用)|


Practise is the what you need to do, the rest problem is ... typing skill ...
