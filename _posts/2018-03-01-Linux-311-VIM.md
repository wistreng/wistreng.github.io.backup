*In the Linux world, most configuration files are plain text in ASCII, so you can modify the settings simply with text editing tools. Unlike Microsoft's Windows, if you're used to Microsoft Word or other GUI, you'll find your text editing programs less intuitive and convenient, but we have to taste bitter before we can appreciate the sweet.*

## 1. Why

There are so many text editors, even in Linux world we still have many choices. We talked about the simple and easy to use Nano in previous chapter, now that you've learned the Nano, why bother to learn the not-so-friendly text editor? 


- *VI* document editors are built into all Unix Like systems. Other document - editors may not exist.
- Many individual software editing interfaces actively call *VI* (such as  crontab, Visudo, Edquota, etc.);
- *VIM* has the ability of program editing, and can actively distinguish the - correctness of grammar by font color, which is convenient for program design.
- Because the program is simple, editing is quite **fast**.


The important is the second point above, because many Linux commands using VI as an default interface for editing.


So what is *VIM*? In fact, you can think of *Vim* as an *IMprove* version of *VI*, where *VIM* can display special information in colors or lines, for example, when you vim a C program files or a shell script, *VIM* will highlight the syntex based on the file extensions or file content. In short, *VIM* is a *programme editor*. Try `vim /etc/fstab`

In a nutshell, *VI* is an old word processor though it is fully functional, but there is still room for improvement. *VIM* is a very useful tool for developers just like *VIM's* [official website](http://www.vim.org) says *VIM* is a *program development tool* rather than a *word editing tools*. Because *VIM* has added a lot of additional features, such as support regex search, multi-file editing, block replication, and so on. This is a great feature for *configuration files revisions* on Linux


## 2. How

Basically, *VI* has two modes, namely *edit mode* and *command mode*. For the sake of clarification, I add a *default mode*. The functions of these three modes are as follows:

- default mode:

    Opening a file in VI goes directly to default mode. In this mode, you can use the up, down, left, and right buttons to move the cursor, you can use delete characters or delete entire lines to handle file content, or copy and paste to handle your file data.


- Edit mode:

    In default mode, file can be deleted, copy, paste and so on but can not edit the file content until you press `I, I, O, o, A, A, R, R` and go into the edit mode. Pay attention! Typically in Linux when you press these buttons, the words "INSERT or REPLACE" appear in the lower left corner of the screen to allow editing. To return to default mode, you must press `Esc` to exit edit mode.


- Command mode:

    In default mode, type any of the three `:/?` to move the cursor to the bottom row. In this mode, you can search, read, save, replace a large number of characters, exit *VI*, display line number, etc.

### 2.1 Simple execution example

- use *VI* to enter the *default mode*
    
    You can do this if you want to use *VI* to create a file called test.txt

    `vi test.txt`

    the bottom line will display:

    `"test.txt" [New File]`

    if you open a existing file, it could be:

    `"/etc/man.config" 141L 4617C`

    means the file has 141 lines and 4617 characters.

- use `i` to enter the *edit mode*
    
    you will found `-- INSERT --` at the bottom, you can edit the file content now.

- Press `Esc` to exit edit mode

- Press `:wq` to save and exit *VI*


### 2.2 vi command


#### *default mode*


| key | desc |
| --- | -------- |
| `h` `j` `k` `l` | move the cursor |
| `0` [zero] | move the cursor to the start of current line | 
| `$` | move the cursor to the end of current line |
| `^f` | move forward one screen |
| `^b` | move backward one screen |
| `^d` | move down half screen |
| `^u` | move up half screen |
| `n<Space>` | move n space |
| `nG` | move to line n |
| `gg` | move to start of line one, not good game |
| `n<Enter>` | move donw n line |
| `w` | begining of next word |
| `b` | begining of last word |


#### *switch between default mode and edit mode*


| * | key | desc |
| - | --- | -------- |
| * | `i` | insert text before cursor, until `<Esc>` hit |
|   | `I` | insert text at beginning of current line, until <Esc> hit |
| * | `a` | append text after cursor, until `<Esc>` hit |
|   | `A` | append text to end of current line, until `<Esc>` hit |
|   | `o` | open and put text in a new line below current line|
|   | `O` | open and put text in a new line above current line|


| * | key | human language translation |
| - | --- | -------- |
|   | `:w` | save |
|   | `:w!` | there is no such thing *forced save* if you don't have permission |
|   | `:q` | quit vi |
| * | `:q!` | quit without ask |
| * | `:wq` | save and quit |
| * | `ZZ` | save and quit |
| * | `:set nu` | display line number, `nonu` means no line number |


#### *command mode - searching*

| key | translation |
| --- | ----------- |
| `/<string>` | forward search for occurence of *string* |
| `?<string>` | backward search for occurence of *string* |
| `n` | move to next search result |
| `N` | move opposite, which means if you current doing forward searching, it will move backwards |
| `:100,200s/config/Config/g` | search "config" and replace with "Config" between 100 and 200 lines |
| `:1,$s/word1/word2/gc` | Look for the Word1 string from the first line to the last line and replace it with word2! A prompt will display to confirm before replace |

#### *command mode - copy, paste and delete*
    
|*|key| translation |
|-|---| ----------- |
| * |`x`, `X` | In a line, `x` deletes a character backwards (equivalent to the `del` key) and `X` deletes a character forwards (equivalent to the `backspace` key)|
| * | `nx`  | n is a number, consecutive backward delete n characters. For |  example, I'm going to delete 10 characters in a row `10|x` |
| * | `dd`  | deletes the entire column where the cursor is |
| * | `ndd` | n is a number. Delete the down n column where the cursor is, for example, `20dd` would delete 20 columns |
|  | `d1G` | deletes all data from the first row to the cursor |
|  | `dG`  | deletes all data from the cursor to the end of the row |
|  | `d$`  | deletes all data from the cursor to the last character of the row |
|  | `d0`  | deletes all data from the first character to the cursor |
| * | `yy`  | copy the line where the cursor is |
|  | `nyy` | n is a number. Copy the down n column where the cursor is. For example, `20yy` copies 20 columns|
|  | `y1G` | copies all data from the first column to the cursor column |
|  | `yG`  | copies all data from the cursor column to the last column |
|  | `y0`  | copies all data from the first character to the cursor  |
|  | `y$`  | copies all data from the cursor to the last character |
| * | `p`, `P`| `p` is to paste the copied data on the next line of the cursor, and `P` is to paste it on the previous line! For example, My cursor is currently on line 20 and I have copied 10 lines of data. After pressing `p`, the 10 lines of data will be pasted after the original 20 lines, i.e., starting from 21 lines. But what if I press `P`? line 20 would been pushed to line 30. |
|  | `J`   | concatenate the cursor column with the data in the next column |
|  | `c`   | repeatedly deletes multiple data, for example, delete 10 rows down `10cj` |
| * | `u`   | restore the previous action whereas `[Ctrl]+r`  redo the last action |
| * | `.`   | no doubt! That's the decimal point! It means to repeat the previous action. If you want to repeat delete, repeat paste, etc., press the decimal point `.` |


The rest problem is ... your typing skill ...
