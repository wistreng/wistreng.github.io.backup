> After Playing SSAS for a while, I found that all attributes have the same properties, and it was really time-consuming to search information for every particular property, so instead of searching everywhere, this blog try to put it under one roof.


## ADVANCED

1. **AttributeHierarchyDisplayFolder** 
    Group the Attributes into a [FolderName]
2. **AttributeHierarchyEnabled** 
    [True] or [False] of Attribute Hierarchies
    
    Determines whether an attribute hierarchy is generated by Analysis Services for the attribute. If the attribute hierarchy is not enabled, the attribute cannot be used in a user-defined hierarchy and the attribute hierarchy cannot be referenced in Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) statements.
3. **AttributeHierarchyOptimizedState**
