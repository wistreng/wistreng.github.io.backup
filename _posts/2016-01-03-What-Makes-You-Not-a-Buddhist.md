### Introduction

*Once, I was seated on a plane in the middle seat of the middle row on a trans-Atlantic flight, and the sympathetic man sitting next to me made an attempt to be friendly. Seeing my shaved head and maroon skirt, he gathered that I was a Buddhist. When the meal was served, the man considerately offered to order a vegetarian meal for me. Having correctly assumed that I was a Buddhist, he also assumed that I don't eat meat. That was the beginning of our chat. The flight was long, so to kill boredom, we discussed Buddhism.*

Over time I have come to realize that people often associate Buddhism and Buddhists with peace, meditation, and nonviolence. In fact many seem to think that saffron or maroon robes and a peaceful smile are all it takes to be a Buddhist. As a fanatical Buddhist myself, I must take pride in this reputation, particularly the nonviolent aspect of it, which is so rare in this age of war and violence, and especially religious violence. Throughtout the history of humankind, religion seems to beget brutality. Even today religious-extremist violence dominates the news. Yet I think I can say with confidence that so far we Buddhists have not disgraced ourselves. Violence has never played a part in propagating Buddhism. However, as a trained Buddhist, I also feel a little discontented when Buddhism is associated with nothing beyond vegetarianism, nonviolence, peace, and meditation. Prince Siddhartha, who sacrificed all the comforts and luxuries of palace life, must have been searching for more than passivity and shrubbery when he set out to discover **enlightenment**.

Although essentially very simple, Buddhism cannot be easily explained. It is almost inconceivably complex, vast and deep. Although it is **nonreligious** and **nontheistic**, it's difficult to present Buddhism without sounding theoretical and religious. As Buddhism traveled to different parts of the world, the **cultural characteristics** it accumulated have made it even more complicated to decipher. Theistic trappings such as incense, bells, and multicolored hats can attact people's attention, but at the same time they can be obstacles. People end up thinking that is all there is to Buddhism and are diverted from its essence.

Sometimes out of frustration that Siddhartha's teaching have not caught on enough for my liking, and sometimes out of my own ambition, I entertain ideas of reforming Buddhism, making it easier - more straightforward and puritanical. It is devious and misguided to imagine (as I sometimes do) simplifing Buddhism into defined, calculated practices like meditating three times a day, adhering certain dress codes, and holding certain ideological beliefs, such as that the whold world must be converted to Buddhism. If we could promise that such practices would provide immediate, tangible results, I think there would be more Buddhists in the world. But when I recover frome these fantasies (which I rarely do), my sober mind warns me that a world of people calling themselves Buddhists would not necessarily be a better world.

Many people mistakenly thing that Buddha is the "GOD" of Buddhism; even some people in commonly recognized Buddhist countries such as Korea, Japan, and Bhutan have these theistic approach to the Buddha and Buddhism. This is why throughout this book we use the name Siddhartha and Buddha interchangeably, to remind people that Buddha was just a man and that this man became Buddha.

It is understandable that some people might think that Buddhists are followers of this external man named Buddha. However, Buddha himself pointed out that we should not venerate a person but rather the wisdom that person teaches. Similarly, it is taken for granted that reincarnation and karma are the most essential beliefs of Buddhism. There are numerous other gross misconceptions. For example, Tibetan Buddhism is sometims referred as "lamaism", and Zen is not even considered Buddhism in some cases. Those people who are slightly more informed, yet still misguided, may use words such as *emptiness* and *nirvana* without understanding their meaning.

When a conversation arises like the one with my seatmate on the plane, a non-Buddhist my casually ask, "What make someone a Buddhist?" That is the hardest question to answer. If the person has a genuine interest, the complete answer does not make for light dinner conversation, and generalization can lead to misunderstanding. Suppose that you give them the true answer, the answer that points to the very foundation of this 2500-year-old tradition.

One is a Buddhist if he or she accepts the following four truths:
- All compounded things are impermanent.
- All emotion are pain.
- All things have no inherent existence.
- Nirvana is beyond concepts.

These four statements, spoken by the Buddha himself, are known as "The four seals". Traditionally, *seal* means something like a hallmark that confirms authenticity. For the sake of simplicity and flow we will refer to these statements herein as both seals and "truths", not to be confused with Buddhism's four nobel truths, which pertain solely to aspects of suffering. Even though the four seals are believed to encompass all of Buddhism, people donot seem to want to hear about them. Without further explanation they serve only to dampen spirits and fail to inspire further interest in may cases. The topic of conversation changes and that's the end of it.
