We know the thing so called Linux is running on a computer, so Linux is a group of softwares. The question is whether it is a operation system or a programme? What kind of computer it's running on? Where it come from? Why it's free? 



## What is Linux

As we all know, computer is consist of a bunch of hardwares, operation system been invented in order to effiently control those hardwares. Apart from allocation of hardwares resources and offer basic functions for running computers, such as networking, memory management, it also provide a set of system interfaces along with a developer-friendly environment to make developers' life easier.

Linux is a operation system as shown below, Linux system includes these two layers: Linux Kernel and systems calls

You can tell from this diagram that the Kernel has a very close relationship with hardwares. Linux got its start on a 386 processor and since it's a operation system which don't have any programmes, after those engineers download and installed it, they can watch the computer starting to work. Those senior engineer will install other software on top of it to meet their needs.

>When Linux kernel was developed by Mr.Torvalds, it's core function is merely drive all the hardwares so that computer with a 386 processor start running and waiting user's command, seldom softwares running on Linux back at that time.

The funny fact is the instruction set vary from different softwares, for instance *IBM Power CPU* architecture is differentiate from *Intel x86* platform, same as you can't install Windows on a Mac computer before 2006. For example, if you want the operating system running on x86 to work on Power CPU, you have to modify the operating system. If you can refer to the functionality of the hardware and modify your operating system code accordingly, the modified operating system will be able to operate on another hardware platform. This is often referred to as a "software porting".

Linux provides a complete operating system of the lowest level of hardware control and resource management of the complete architecture, this architecture is the legacy of Unix good tradition, so quite stable and powerful! 

With an overview of what Linux is, let's talk about, "Why is Linux a stable operating system? How did it come about?"
