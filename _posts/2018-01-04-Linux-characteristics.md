### The characteristics of Linux

So what are the special functions of this system? To put it simply:


- Free and open use and learning environment:


Because Linux is gPL-licensed, it is free software, meaning that anyone can use or modify the source code! This kind of open architecture is very important to the scientific community! Because many engineers due to special needs, often need to modify the system source code, so that the system can meet their own needs! And this open architecture will be able to meet the different needs of engineers! So of course it's likely to become more and more popular! The latest air quality model, Model-3 /CMAQ, is based on Linux.


- Low demand:


Linux can support the x86 architecture of personal computers, and system resources don't have to be tailored to a single company's devices, as earlier Unix systems were! That alone would be a huge hit! However, if you want to run an X Window system on Linux, the hardware level should not be too low!


- Core functions are strong and stable:


And because Linux features will not be lost to some large Unix workstations, in recent years, more and more companies or groups, individuals into the development and integration of this operating system! For example, IBM and Sun Rise have both launched x86 Linux servers!


- Independent operation:


In addition, because many software suites are gradually used by this operating system, and many software suites are developed and tested on the Linux operating system, Linux has recently been able to complete almost all the workstation or server services, such as Web, Mail, Proxy, FTP... .


Linux is already quite a mature operating system. And it doesn't consume resources and it's freely available! Ha ha, can say cause Microsoft quite big pressure! In addition, due to the low hardware requirements of its system, and the fact that many people have quite a few obsoleted hardware devices on hand due to the "Intel conspiracy", Linux performs fairly smoothly and stably on obsolete hardware! Therefore also causes quite many friends' attention!

>Ha ha! Joking, because Tom's hardware review (http://www.big5.tomshardware.com/) website often made fun of Intel said so! Oh! Very funny! Bird's diagram


This is what makes Linux one of the most popular operating systems of the last few years, and as I mentioned, it's mostly because it's "free," which is the operating system that's freely available. Then it is an open system, which means that you can get the source code of the program at any time, which is very important for the program development engineer! And, although it is Free Free software, but the function is very powerful! In addition, Linux for hardware requirements is low, the main reason that caused it more popular, because too fast hardware turnover, so a lot of people there are very few in the at hand with the parts, these parts group of a group can be used to run Linux, anyway do without using a workstation to the screen (as long as the host can then), so the Linux is more and more popular!


>That is because Linux has 1. Low hardware demand, 2. Open architecture, 3. Strong system stability and confidentiality, and 4. Completely free, so some so-called "anti-Microsoft alliance" programming masters constantly develop new software! To compete with Microsoft! Bird's diagram

### Linux's strengths and weaknesses


So why use Linux as our host system? This is because Linux has the following advantages:


- Stable system:

Linux is an operating system developed based on the concept of Unix. Therefore, Linux has a program interface and operation mode similar to that of Unix systems. Of course, Linux also inherits the characteristics of Unix stability and efficiency. It's not uncommon to hear that a Linux host has been running for more than a year without crashing or shutting down.


- Free or for a small fee:

Because Linux is a gPL-licensed product, it is freely available to anyone, and some "installation kits" are available for a small fee! Unlike Unix, which has huge royalties to pay, and certainly unlike Microsoft, which has to update your system over and over again, and for a lot of money!


- Quick repair of security and vulnerability:

If you play the Internet a lot, the most common thing you'll hear is "No host is perfectly safe"! That's right! However, due to the popularity of Linux supporters, there are quite a number of enthusiastic groups and individuals involved in the development, so you can always get the latest security information, and give updates at any time, that is, it is relatively safe!


- Multi-tasking, multi-user:

Unlike Windows, Linux hosts can allow multiple people to work online at the same time, and the allocation of resources is more equitable, which is much more stable than the Windows single-person multitasking system. This multi-tasking is a pretty good feature on UNIX-like. You can plan different levels of users on a Linux host, and each user can log into the system in a different environment, and you can allow different users to log in at the same time and use the host's resources.


- User and group planning:

On Linux machines, the attributes of a file can be divided into "readable, writable, executable" parameters to define the applicability of a file, and they can be divided into three categories: "file owner, group to which the file belongs, and other non-owners and groups." This provides fairly good system confidentiality for project planner or other planner developers.


- Relatively resource-efficient systems:

Linux can be installed and used on a P-III or higher computer. You don't need a P-4 or AMD K8 level computer yet! However, if you are setting up a large mainframe (hosting systems that serve more than a hundred people), then you need a better machine. However, any personal computer currently on the market can meet this requirement.


- Suitable for embedded systems requiring small core programs:

Since Linux can drive the entire computer hardware and become a complete operating system with less than a few hundred K program code, it is quite suitable for the current operating system of household appliances or small electronic supplies! That is the popular Fried chicken "embedded" system! Linux is really suitable for such as mobile phones, digital cameras, Pdas, home appliances, and so on the microcomputer operating system! ^_^


- Integrated and diverse graphical user interface (GUI) :

Since 1994 Linux 1.0 after joining the X Window system, under the efforts of many hackers and Linux finally have a high degree of integration, and the main graphics card companies (Intel, NVidia, ATI, etc.) have launched the latest driver for Linux, so Linux GUI has made great progress! In addition, there is more than one graphical interface for Linux. Both KDE(http://www.kde.org/) and GNOME(http://www.gnome.org) are very common!


Anyway, the benefits of Linux are endless! But for all its benefits, Linux has one fatal flaw in its nature that limits its popularity: it needs to be managed using "command line" terminal mode! Although in recent years, there are a lot of graphical interface development used in Linux, but after all, to be familiar with Linux or to use the instruction line is better, so to accept Linux players must be more familiar with the behavior of computer instructions, rather than using the mouse click icon! Where Linux can be improved:


- No specific support vendor:

Because almost every suite on Linux is free software, and every developer of free software may not be a corporate group, but a non-profit group. So, what if something goes wrong with the software on your Linux host? Fortunately, due to the good integration of Linux business, Red Hat and SuSE, which are relatively famous in Taiwan, have set up service points. You can purchase/consult with them directly via this service point. But what if you were not choosing Linux distributions with a special commercial company? How to do? There is no special person to the government service ~ this is not need to worry too much, because thanks to the popularity of the Internet, almost all the questions you want to ask can be found on the Internet! See if you have the heart to look for it!


- Insufficient support for the game:

In modern this time, dare to say that your home desktop computer inside the game should not be many children! Game software is also an application, so it is quite closely related to the operating system. Unfortunately, many game developers currently don't make big games on Linux, which indirectly prevents Linux from reaching the average home.


- Insufficient support for professional software:

This is one of the things that Tomboy discovered after he went to school for teaching. Currently, many professional drawing software companies launch professional software that does not support Linux operating system, which makes it difficult for students to operate the same software on different platforms! Alas! Very nerve-racking ~


- Education and training are not good enough:

If you can teach children to use free software in elementary school, they will naturally use free software when they grow up! Taiwan is still quite ambivalent in terms of its current policy, and hopes to give free software some opportunities in the future.


To be honest, most of these shortcomings are not Linux per se, but rather policy and business considerations that are the biggest bugbears. But Linux, like any other operating system, is just a tool! I hope you have fun learning the essence of Linux! ^_^

### About authorization


Now there are a lot of software on the market, some free software, some patent software. Some patent software free, some free software to pay ~ ah! Good bother! How do you tell these things apart? In fact, bird brother is not a lawyer, for the law is not very understand, but there are a few authorization model can talk about ~


- Open Source (Open Source)


    When the software is released in the way of Open Source, it means that in addition to the executable software itself, it must be accompanied by the release of the Source code. There are several benefits to Open Source's software in general:


        1. Programmers usually wait until the program is mature before they give it up, so usually the program has a fairly good constitution when it is in its embryonic form.


        2. The spirit of Open Source, I believe that when the program is the original designer will release the program Source code, after other programmers after accepting the original code, due to the need to change the program to your required style, so will by itself, what they have learned to improve it, and to improve it and pest control, so the application of the debug function will be faster than traditional close to the Source!


        3. Because the program is accompanied by the source code, therefore, the system will not be easy to exist little-known Trojan program or some security vulnerabilities, relatively speaking, will be more secure!


The representative authorization of Open Source is THE GPL license of GNU, BSD, etc., and the well-known Open Source license page is listed below:


GNU General Public License:

http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL

Currently, there are version 2 and Version 3, and Linux USES Version 2. Bird elder brother has collected a culture the provisions of the GPL version 2, you can refer to: http://cn.linux.vbird.org/linux_basic/1010appendix_A.php


Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) :

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license

BSD source Code is the most common contact with the BSD authorization mode! This licensing model is actually very similar to the GPL, and its spirit echoes that of the Open Source!


Apache License, Version 2.0:

http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

Apache is a kind of web server software, which is also distributed by using Open Source. Only under the Apache license, if you want to redistribute the software (if you have modified the software), the name of the software should still be Apache!



The Close Source


Whereas Open Source software emits the Source code, Close Source programs only emit executable programs. The advantage of this kind of software is that there is a person to maintain it, you don't need to change it; The disadvantage is that the flexibility is greatly reduced and the user cannot change the program to the style they want! In addition, if there are Trojan horses or security holes, it will take quite a long time to debug
